## Issues:
* hitting two flip pads in a row sometimes messes up view.
* ensure at least one pad per level

## more interesting
* firing decreases speed 50%
* more interaction with environment. Hit buildings glow for a bit?
* camera motion?
* try speeding up

## Dev Items
* buildings contain hidden treasures (energy, powerup)
* hero state (health, shields, items) presists between levels
* leader board
* loading screen
* restart at end of game
* [optimize for fullscreen](http://www.onlywebpro.com/2015/07/19/optimizing-full-screen-mobile-web-app-for-ios/)
* yellow flash or something when going over point pad
* make guns things you can pick up
* [see where blasts hit buildings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11586527/converting-world-coordinates-to-screen-coordinates-in-three-js-using-projection)
* reward text like: "Legendary!" or "combo!"
